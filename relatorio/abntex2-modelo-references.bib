@article{Monteiro2018,
abstract = {Urban energy modelling requires a large amount of detailed data to perform systematic dynamic simulations of a large number of buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency strategies is an important concern for sustainable urban planning. National statistical datasets collect important aggregated data regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data of their territory. However, these data is generally not detailed enough, being available at different scales and in different formats. The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in addressing its energy saving potential. Furthermore, scenario analysis for retrofit or new design is only possible at building scale, highlighting the potential of a bottom-up database. This paper presents the process of collecting, mapping, cleansing and integrating urban data resulting in an UBD to support an information system for Smart Cities. The goal is to reduce the gap between the available urban data and the specific data required to run a complete urban building energy simulation. Key characteristics of an UBD are explored and applied to a case study in Lisbon, Portugal. As a result, a Buildings Dashboard is developed, materializing the UBD user interface. This dashboard allows the interactive visualization and data exploration of the building stock at multiple scales. Future work includes the development of an Urban Scenario category, bringing new insights on urban energy simulation and scenario evaluation to this platform.},

@article{Walasek2017,
abstract = {In an effort to remedy the issue of stagnant labor productivity in the construction industry, Building Information Modeling was proposed in the late 80's as a new solution for streamlining the design and delivery process of construction projects. BIM is a digital representation of a building meant to serve all project participants as a repository of all relevant data throughout the project's lifecycle. Management of this data along with the collaborative nature of BIM has been shown to offer many potential benefits to those involved in the project. Despite the huge potential for increasing productivity as well as the overall efficiency of construction projects, the adoption of BIM throughout the industry has been observed as slower than expected. This paper explores and analyzes the various barriers hindering the widespread adoption of BIM throughout the industry as well as proposes methods for addressing them. The author then answers the question of who should be responsible for driving the adoption of BIM and how to effectively do it. Finally the author proposes areas of further research and development which will assist in achieving a more widespread adoption of BIM throughout the industry.},

In this sense we note that the students have difficulties in understanding and implementation of the problems proposed by the teacher. The main idea of this paper is to show that the logical reasoning of computer programming students can be efficiently developed by using at the same time Turing Machine, cellular automata (Wolfram rule) and fractals theory via Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The results indicate that this approach is useful, but the teacher needs introducing, in an interdisciplinary context, the simple theory of cellular automata and the fractals before the problem implementation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The shear behavior of micro-scale truss structures formed from a three-dimensional interconnected pattern of self-propagating polymer waveguides was investigated. These structures had sub-millimeter size features and comprised a repeating octahedral-type unit cell designed to suppress bending in the truss members prior to initial failure. For a typical shear loading method, the experimentally measured shear moduli deviated from predicted values as the relative density decreased. However, the mechanical behavior changed when the shear loading condition was altered to distribute the load more uniformly between all truss members and the measured shear modulus was aligned with predicted values. The shear strength and total plateau strain of these structures were strongly dependent on the mode of failure and the uniformity with which the truss member failure was distributed through the thickness of the structure. Furthermore, plateau strains of up to 60{\%} were achieved when all truss members in compression buckled uniformly. Thermo-oxidation reaction of the polymer micro-truss structures caused an increase in the shear modulus and maximum shear strength (up to 2.9MPa), although oxidized structures fractured at the maximum shear strain.},

By redefining the criteria of the optimization evolution progress, the proposed method is able to extend current BESO method from isotropic material to anisotropic composite material. The initial modification of BESO method is to allow for inefficient Material Element String (MES) to be removed while efficient MES to be added in the thickness direction of a composite structure. This modification can reduce the chance of high stress concentration in a composite structure and also produce the geometry which is easy to fabricate using fabrication techniques currently available. The results of a cantilever composite laminate under uniform inplane pressure are presented, showing that the proposed method can produce shape and topology for composite structures with optimal structure stiffness.},

abstract = {Generative systems have been widely used to produce two- and three-dimensional constructs, in an attempt to escape from our preconceptions and pre-existing spatial language. The challenge is to use this mechanism in real-world architectural contexts in which complexity and constraints imposed by the design problem make it difficult to negotiate between the emergent output, the context, and the controllability desired by the human designer. This thesis investigates how generative systems address contextual parameters, including the designer, client, user, meaning, aesthetics, environment, and function. This is demonstrated through my case studies, in which my aim was to avoid computerized unprocessed formalism that does not implicitly allow for any contextual and cultural content. I sought to extend simple algorithmic form-generation processes to allow for the subtleties of a given context to be effectively addressed. Some challenges and questions arose from these case studies. By interrogating different generative machines, common threads and challenges, similar to mine encountered in the case studies, were found. All of the processes that strove towards the creation of a generative system struggled with similar issues: How can we use rule-based systems without sacrificing meaning or function or the humanistic touch?

abstract = {The architectural layout design problem, which is concerned with the finding of the best adjacencies between functional spaces among many possible ones under given constraints, can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and can be solved with an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). We present functional spaces and their adjacencies in form of graphs and propose an EA called EvoArch that works with a graph-encoding scheme. EvoArch encodes topological configuration in the adjacency matrices of the graphs that they represent and its reproduction operators operate on these adjacency matrices. In order to explore the large search space of graph topologies, these reproduction operators are designed to be unbiased so that all nodes in a graph have equal chances of being selected to be swapped or mutated. To evaluate the fitness of a graph, EvoArch makes use of a fitness function that takes into consideration preferences for adjacencies between different functional spaces, budget and other design constraints. By means of different experiments, we show that EvoArch can be a very useful tool for architectural layout design tasks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, as the graph increases in complexity it quickly becomes inflexible and unsuitable for exploring a wide design space.

In response to these two extremes, the authors propose a new approach called Meta-Parametric Design, combining graph-based parametric modelling with genetic programming.

abstract = {Porous thin films are the main candidates to achieve Ultra Low K materials for interlayer dielectric (ILD) applications, but their mechanical properties remain low. Indeed, the introduction of porosity significantly decreases the dielectric constant $\kappa$, but also affects the mechanical properties. However, both mechanical and dielectric performances are influenced by the pore arrangement and geometry that can thus be optimized for these two antagonist properties. A Finite Element study is conducted to quantify the influence of the arrangement and the geometry of the pores via a homogenization approach. The best architectures for ILD applications are deduced. Random arrangements as well as 3D cubic arrangements (simple, body-centered, face-centered) of monodisperse spherical pores have been considered. These arrangements are obtainable by sol-gel processing, a method that often induces a marked shrinkage of the films. This shrinkage modifies the original cubic arrangements which become orthorhombic and the pore shape which becomes ellipsoidal. The effect on the dielectric and elastic properties of these architectural changes due to the shrinkage has also been studied. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, four simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithms - SMOSA, UMOSA, PSA and WMOSA have been used to solve multiobjective optimization of constrained problems with varying degree of complexity along with a new PDMOSA algorithm. PDMOSA algorithm uses a strategy of Pareto dominant based fitness in the acceptance criteria of simulated annealing and is improved. In all algorithms, the current solution explores its neighborhoods in a way similar to that of classical simulated annealing. The performance and computational cost for all algorithms have been studied. All algorithms are found to be quite robust with algorithmic parameters and are capable of generating a large number of well diversified Pareto-optimal solutions. The quality and diversification of Pareto-optimal solutions generated by all algorithms are found to be problem specific. The computational cost is least by WMOSA and is followed by PDMOSA. The algorithms are simple to formulate and require reasonable computational time. Hence, the simultaneous use of all algorithms is suggested to obtain a wider spectrum of efficient solutions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The envelope shape, the most salient design characteristic in a building, has significant influence on its energy performance. However, in the early design stages, when the envelope shape is defined, energy performance information is normally nonexistent, due to modeling for energy simulation being a time-consuming task, frequently overlooked at this phase. This paper presents a methodology to assist design decisions regarding the building envelope shape considering its implications on energy performance. Basically, this methodology involves a flexible design system, to generate alternative envelope shape designs, with integrated energy simulation, to calculate the energy demand of each design. Shape grammars are particularly suitable to encode architectural design systems, given their ability to encode compositional design principles. Their downside is the complexity in developing computer implementations. This methodology converts a grammar into a parametric design system and is illustrated with an application to the grammar for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Based on techniques from graphic statics, the force distribution in building structures is visualized using geometric diagrams. This diagrammatic representation allows a formal description that shows the relationship between the force flow and the structural form. The formal character of this description enables the direct implementation of a parametric truss geometry that maintains major structural behavioral characteristics under deformation. An interactive model of a structural freeform roof is developed through this link between a parametric truss definition and a design-driving NURBS surface. This allows for an intuitive exploration of the constrained design space in real time. Formal explorations and the comparison with built examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

abstract = {Designing User Interfaces (UIs) is considered a creative and human-intensive task, and this prevents from adopting computer-aided tools to explore alternative solutions. A number of decisions are to be taken, such as optimizing the displacement of UI items on the available screen space or selecting an adequate palette of colors. Therefore, the UI design process is iterative in nature, time consuming, and costly. Generative design, while keeping the centrality of human creativity, introduces a novel approach to assist humans in finding effective and esthetically convincing solutions. Meta-heuristics are a means to apply generative design in practice. We advocate the use of meta-heuristics to supporting different aspects of the UI design process. In this paper we discuss the application of genetic algorithms to solve two different problems: building hierarchical menu layouts and selecting color palettes based on a set of constraints. The paper discusses the results of two experimental applications developed in Poste Italiane, namely the money ordering by Automated Teller Machine (ATM) interfaces and the provision of financial information by kiosks. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

While there has been an increasing interest in the use of GAs in architecture, there has not yet been a systematic study of the operation of GAs and their application in architecture yet. This paper investigates whether the utilization of GAs is a necessity or a trend; whether GAs are used to accommodate specific needs of architecture or merely to bear innovative and complex forms; and consequently whether GAs serve reality or utopia. In order to answer these questions, the paper examines the operation of GAs in other disciplines and in architecture as well as the implications of its applications in architecture.

BIMs emerged as a result of a push by the software companies, to tackle the problems of inefficient information exchange between different software and to enable true interoperability. In BIM approach most up-to-date an accurate models of a building are stored in shared central databases during the design and the construction of a project and at post-construction stages. GIS based city monitoring / city management applications require the fusion of information acquired from multiple resources, BIMs, City Models and Sensors. This paper focuses on providing a method for facilitating the GIS based fusion of information residing in digital building “Models” and information acquired from the city objects i.e. “Things”. Once this information fusion is accomplished, many fields ranging from Emergency Response, Urban Surveillance, Urban Monitoring to Smart Buildings will have potential benefits.},

abstract = {Many different techniques for measuring material appearance have been proposed in the last few years. These have produced large public datasets, which have been used for accurate, data-driven appearance modeling. However, although these datasets have allowed us to reach an unprecedented level of realism in visual appearance, editing the captured data remains a challenge. In this paper, we present an intuitive control space for predictable editing of captured BRDF data, which allows for artistic creation of plausible novel material appearances, bypassing the difficulty of acquiring novel samples. We first synthesize novel materials, extending the existing MERL dataset up to 400 mathematically valid BRDFs. We then design a large-scale experiment, gathering 56,000 subjective ratings on the high-level perceptual attributes that best describe our extended dataset of materials. Using these ratings, we build and train networks of radial basis functions to act as functionals mapping the perceptual attributes to an underlying PCA-based representation of BRDFs. We show that our functionals are excellent predictors of the perceived attributes of appearance. Our control space enables many applications, including intuitive material editing of a wide range of visual properties, guidance for gamut mapping, analysis of the correlation between perceptual attributes, or novel appearance similarity metrics. Moreover, our methodology can be used to derive functionals applicable to classic analytic BRDF representations. We release our code and dataset publicly, in order to support and encourage further research in this direction.},

abstract = {This paper studies the influence of architectural education and early experience of the work of a group pf architects, whose work shows strong features of bioclimatic integration (such as Lele and Severiano Porto in Brazil and Spencer de Grey and Mario Cucinella in Europe). The first analysis of their individual experiences, through semi-structured interviews, indicates that the integration of bioclimatic concepts into design is beyond the development or improvement of tools. First of all, it is fundamental that these concepts are part of the design philosophy of the professional, which is determinant on the application of research and innovation in architectural practice. Therefore, before the tools, the formal education can be a tool to promote the inclusion of these principles as part of their design philosophy, influencing the approach to design. It happened in the cases in which there was a commitment of the school to develop a technical knowledge basis in building physics into studio activities, highlighting the aesthetic character of environmental integration. This basis was consolidated in the contact with the building site construction, which also strengthened their ethical commitment regarding the quality of the built object. It has the potential to generate confidence in the consideration of these issues, also making it easier to get the right information from available resources and tools, via a critical understanding of the different issues.},

In order to speed up housing delivery, Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) have employed advanced technologies, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), in some of their pilot prefabrication-based construction projects. However, the information obtained from BIM and RFID is not well connected and shared among relevant stakeholders. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled BIM platform (MITBIMP) to achieve real-time visibility and traceability in prefabricated construction. Design considerations of a RFID Gateway Operating System, visibility and traceability tools, Data Source Interoperability Services, and decision support services are specified for developing the MITBIMP. A case study from a real-life construction project in Hong Kong is used as a pilot project to demonstrate advanced decision-making by using cutting-edge concepts and technologies within the MITBIMP to providing a basis for real-time visibility and traceability of the whole processes of prefabrication-based construction.},

@phdthesis{ddaves2013,
abstract = {In this thesis I consider the relationship between the design of software and the design of flexible parametric models. There is growing evidence that parametric models employed in practice lack the flexibility to accommodate certain design changes. When a designer attempts to change a model's geometry (by modifying the model's underlying functions and parameters) they occasionally end up breaking the model. The designer is then left with a dilemma: spend time building a new model, or abandon the changes and revise the old model. Similar dilemmas exist in software engineering. Despite these shared concerns, Robert Woodbury (2010, 66) states that there is currently “little explicit connection” between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. In this thesis I consider, using a reflective practice methodology, how software engineering may inform parametric modelling. Across three case studies I take aspects of the software engineering body of knowledge (language paradigms; structured programming; and interactive programming) and apply them to the design of parametric models for the Sagrada Fam{\'{i}}lia, the Dermoid pavilion, and the Responsive Acoustic Surface. In doing so I establish three new parametric modelling methods. The contribution of this research is to show there are connections between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. These include the following: • Shared challenges: Both practices involve unexpected changes occurring within the rigid logic of computation. • Shared research methods: Research methods from software engineering apply to the study of parametric modelling. • Shared practices: The software engineering body of knowledge seems to offer a proven pathway for improving the practice of parametric modelling. These connections signal that software engineering is an underrepresented and important precedent for architects using parametric models; a finding that has implications for how parametric modelling is taught, how parametric models are integrated with practice, and for how researchers study and discuss parametric modelling.},

Previous applications of cellular automata to architectural design have oftentimes been characterised by their limited generative capacity for top–down developmental control and for pragmatic rule-breaking as they are easily offered by human designers. This paper explores different options for modifying and extending classical cellular automata systems to support architectural form finding. It discusses the potential of cellular automata as generative design tools with respect to the questions: In which part of a design development, during which periods during a design process and in what roles do cellular automata promise desirable results from a practical standpoint? In response to these questions, a theoretical framework for the integration of cellular automata into the design process is presented. An implementation of a dialogue-based cellular automata-supported design process model is outlined and evaluated by remodelling an existing architectural design project.},

This approach consists of a unified diagram which incorporates both the frame and stress diagrams. This unified representation is applied to a simple Maxwell frame and the authors include a rigorous investigation of the equivalence between the unified diagram and traditional diagrams. The paper shows that traditional diagrams can, in fact, be regarded as particular cases of the unified diagram. The concept of self-reciprocity is introduced and a dual kinematic interpretation of the unified diagram is obtained from a sequence of equivalent diagrams. These diagrams can be obtained in a straightforward manner by changing the force scale factor. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ability to process large amounts of data and to extract useful insights from data has revolutionised society. This phenomenon—dubbed as Big Data—has applications for a wide assortment of industries, including the construction industry. The construction industry already deals with large volumes of heterogeneous data; which is expected to increase exponentially as technologies such as sensor networks and the Internet of Things are commoditised. In this paper, we present a detailed survey of the literature, investigating the application of Big Data techniques in the construction industry. We reviewed related works published in the databases of American Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and Elsevier Science Direct Digital Library. While the application of data analytics in the construction industry is not new, the adoption of Big Data technologies in this industry remains at a nascent stage and lags the broad uptake of these technologies in other fields. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive survey of Big Data techniques in the context of the construction industry. This paper fills the void and presents a wide-ranging interdisciplinary review of literature of fields such as statistics, data mining and warehousing, machine learning, and Big Data Analytics in the context of the construction industry. We discuss the current state of adoption of Big Data in the construction industry and discuss the future potential of such technologies across the multiple domain-specific sub-areas of the construction industry. We also propose open issues and directions for future work along with potential pitfalls associated with Big Data adoption in the industry.},

@article{Okasha2009,
abstract = {The need to design and construct structural systems with adequate levels of reliability and redundancy is widely acknowledged. It is as crucial that these desired levels are maintained above target levels throughout the life of the structure. Optimization has served well in providing safer and more economical maintenance strategies. Lifetime maintenance optimization based on system reliability has already been proposed. It is still needed, however, to incorporate redundancy in the lifetime maintenance optimization process. Treating both system reliability and redundancy as criteria in the lifetime optimization process can be highly rewarding. The complexity of the process, however, requires the automation of solving the optimization problem. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used in this study to obtain solutions to the multi-objective optimization problems considering system reliability, redundancy and life-cycle cost (LCC). An approach to provide the optimization program the ability to optimally select what maintenance actions are applied, when they are applied, and to which structural components they are applied is presented. Two different strategies are proposed. The first strategy has the ability to optimally select mixed maintenance types to apply to different parts of the structure at the same time. This strategy can be used in cases where any combination of different maintenance options can be practically applied to any part of the structure. The application of this strategy on truss structures is shown in a numerical example. The second strategy can be used when a limited number of possibilities of practical maintenance options are available. The application of this strategy to bridge structures is shown in a numerical example. The greatest advantage of the proposed approach (both strategies) is its ability to avoid the application of maintenance interventions to structural components that are not critical. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the Korean housing market, mass customization (MC) is an inevitable strategy for ensuring competitiveness. However, though customer needs have varied rapidly under the customer-oriented market conditions, the level of customization for houses has been restricted by economics of scale in the construction processes. With the rise of the level of customization, the cost of site management has increased because of additional labour. Therefore, this paper introduces the finishing information system (FIS), which can be used to minimize the additional commitment of manpower due to higher levels of MC. To illustrate and validate this system, a case study was performed in a real apartment complex project. The results showed that additional manpower for site management was decreased by quicker completion of the job, simplification of the management process, and efficiency of communication.},

abstract = {Although IP multicast has been proposed and investigated for years, there are major problems inherent in the IP multicasting technique, e.g. difficulty to scale up the system, difficulty in allocating a globally unique multicast address, complexity in supporting higher level features such as reliable data transfer and congestion/flow control, more importantly, difficulty to deploy on the current Internet infrastructure due to necessity to change many core routers. Recently, end-system multicast (ESM) has been proposed as an alternative solution so that multicasting services can be quickly deployed. In this paper, we consider the 'architectural' and 'optimization' issues on designing an ESM-tree. Specifically, we present a distributed algorithm on how to create and maintain an ESM-tree. We propose a distributed algorithm to perform tree optimization (TO) so that an ESM-tree can dynamically adapt to the changing network condition (e.g. drop in transfer bandwidth) so that the nodes within an ESM-tree can receive data more efficiently. The distributed algorithm has the important theoretical properties that at all times, a tree topology can be maintained and any node joining, leaving, as well as any TO operation will not 'partition' the underlying ESM-tree. Therefore, our work can be used to provide an efficient architectural infrastructure for ESM services. We have implemented a prototype ESM system and carried out experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and the performance gains of our ESM optimization protocol. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Brainerd2016,
abstract = {We present a novel method for real-time rendering of subdivision surfaces whose goal is to make subdivision faces as easy to ren- der as triangles, points, or lines. Our approach uses standard GPU tessellation hardware and processes each face of a base mesh inde- pendently, thus allowing an entire model to be rendered in a single pass. The key idea of our method is to subdivide the u, v domain of each face ahead of time, generating a quadtree structure, and then submit one tessellated primitive per input face. By traversing the quadtree for each post-tessellation vertex, we are able to accurately and efficiently evaluate the limit surface. Our method yields a more uniform tessellation of the surface, and faster rendering, as fewer primitives are submitted. We evaluate our method on a variety of assets, and realize performance that can be three times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our streaming formulation makes it easier to integrate subdivision surfaces into applications and shader code written for polygonal models. We illustrate inte- gration of our technique into a full-featured video game engine.},

We present a new co-training style algorithm which employs a generative classifier (Naive Bayes) and a discriminative classifier (Support Vector Machine) as base classifiers, to take advantage of both methods. Furthermore, we introduce a pair of weight parameters to balance the impact of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and define a hybrid objective function to tune their values during co-training. The final prediction is given by the combination of base classifiers, and we define a pseudo-validation set to regulate their weight. Additionally, we present a strategy of pseudo-labeled data selecting to deal with the class imbalance problem. Experimental results on six datasets show that our method performs much better in practice, especially when the amount of labeled data is small.},

abstract = {Lisp is the world's greatest programming language—or so its proponents think. The structure of Lispmakes it easy to extend the language or even to implement entirely new dialects without starting from scratch. Overall, the evolution of Lisp has been guided more by institutional rivalry, one-upsmanship, and the glee born of technical cleverness that is characteristic of the “hacker culture” than by sober assessments of technical requirements. Nevertheless this process has eventually produced both an industrial- strength programming language, messy but powerful, and a technically pure dialect, small but powerful, that is suitable for use by programming-language theoreticians. We pick up where McCarthy's paper in the first HOPL conference left off. We trace the development chronologically from the era of the PDP-6, through the heyday of Interlisp and MacLisp, past the ascension and decline of special purpose Lisp machines, to the present era of standardization activities. We then examine the technical evolution of a few representative language features, including both some notable successes and some notable failures, that illuminate design issues that distinguish Lisp from other programming languages. We also discuss the use of Lisp as a laboratory for designing other programming languages. We conclude with some reflections on the forces that have driven the evolution of Lisp.},

In real-world applications, failures of the measuring equipment can lead to a situation in which a selected model becomes unusable because of the volatility of the independent variables set. This paper presents an adaptive system for dam behavior modeling that is based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model and is optimized for given conditions using genetic algorithms (GA). Throughout an evolutionary process, the system performs real-time adjustment of regressors in the MLR model according to currently active sensors. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in a case study of modeling the Bocac dam (at the Vrbas River located in the Republic of Srpska), whereby an MLR model of the dam displacements has been optimized for periods when the sensors were malfunctioning. Results of the analysis have shown that, under real-world circumstances, the proposed methodology outperforms traditional regression approaches. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To prove the methodology, a 3D city model has been generated with semi-automatic methods at LoD2 (Level of Detail 2) of CityGML (City Geographic Markup Language) using the data of the study area over Cesme Town of Izmir Province, Turkey. The generated model is automatically textured and additional developments have been performed for 3D visualization of the model on the web.

abstract = {Generative design systems take an active part in the generation of computational design models. They make it easier for designers to explore conceptual alternatives, but the amount of information generated during a design session can become very large. Intelligent navigation aids are needed to enable designers to access the information with ease and low cognitive loads. We present an approach to support navigation in generative design systems. Our approach takes account of studies related to navigation in physical environ- ments as well as information navigation in electronic media. Results of studies from the physical environment and electronic media reveal that 1) people exhibit similar cognitive behaviors (spatial cognition and the use of spatial knowledge) while navigating in physical and information spaces; and 2) the information space lacks legibility and imageability. The proposed information navigation model takes these findings into account.},

abstract = {We live in a digital world. Our phones, our cars, our banks, and our hospitals – nearly every aspect of our lives – depend on computer code. As a result, coding, or computer programming, is becoming a core skill requirement for many well-paying jobs. Coding skills are in-demand across a broad range of careers, not just for programmers. The ability not only to use but also to program software is often required of business people who work with data, of designers and marketers who create websites, of engineers who build products and technologies, and of scientists who conduct research. This report analyzes the job market demand for coding skills in order to highlight the breadth and magnitude of employer demand for these skills and the range of opportunities that learning to code can open for students. The intent of this research is to showcase for school counselors and K-12 students alike the importance of learning to code and the value these skills will have in the job market. The data contained in this report are drawn from 26 million U.S. online job postings collected in 2015 and have been analyzed to determine the specific jobs and skills that employers are seeking.},

@phdthesis{fasoulaki2008,
abstract = {There are building systems, called "modularized", in which the component systems (for structure, lighting, etc) can be analyzed and synthesized independently since their performance and design do not interact or affect one another. There are other building systems, called "coupled", in which the component systems do interact and influence one another. The thesis acknowledges that in a building there are both sub-systems that act independently and others that interact. While many design processes have been proposed for dealing with discrete sub-systems, there is no systematic study for building sub-systems that interrelate. This thesis examines a different design approach called integrated. The term "integrated" has a dual utilization in this study. The first use refers to the integration of form and building performance. The second use refers to the integration of interrelated and diverse building performances involving multiple disciplines. The integrated design approach analyzes and evaluates several interrelated design systems involving different disciplines in the early design phase. The goal of the approach is the generation of design alternatives guided simultaneously by two basic objectives: the aspiration for form exploration and the satisfaction of the performances of interrelated systems. After defining a framework for an integrated design approach, which includes inter-disciplinary collaboration, unified design, optimization, simulation, and other formal and digital techniques, the approach will be demonstrated in a case study. The objective of the case study is to demonstrate that the integrated design approach has validity and can be realized, in this case, for the generation of high-rise buildings guided by structural, lighting, zoning codes, and aesthetic criteria.},

Algorithmic language assumes virtual materiality and relies on computerized images. Generative design processes therefore present unique aesthetics that carry within themselves traces of materiality, which architects such as Oosterhuis, MatSys, ChrisBosse, Morphosis Architects, Zaha Hadid, Biothing, Material Ecology, Gregg Lynn and Evan Douglis explore in the physical world. This research examines aesthetics of Parametric design, Cellular automata, Flocking of birds, Genetic algorithms, and Shape grammars to define framework for evaluating material applicability to generative design processes. In this paper, I put the Aesthetics of Generative Design in a historical context. I define aesthetic implications of algorithmic systems with regard to shape generation and systemize generative design according to essential and accidental aesthetic qualities. Finally, I link Materiality and Performance to aesthetic variations within Generative Design.},

@article{Querin2006,
abstract = {The evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method has been under continuous development since 1992. Traditionally, the method was conceived from the engineering perspective that the topology and shape of structures were naturally conservative for safety reasons and therefore contained an excess of material. To move from the conservative design to a more optimum design would therefore involve the removal of material. Thus the ESO method started from a design space much bigger than the optimum and the final topology or shape emerged by a process of removal of unwanted/inefficient/lowly stresses material. The original algorithms allowed for two forms of evolution. One was there the understressed material could be removed from anywhere in the allowable design space, and with compensation for checker-boarding this produces an optimum topology under the prescribed environments. The second form only allows removal from the surface or parts of the surface (called nibbling in the ESO lexicon); this produces a Min-Max situation where the maximum surface stress is reduced to a minimum. It has been demonstrated that the ESO process produces a surface that is an iso-stress contour thus satisfying the Min-Max optimality criterion. The present paper addresses the opposite evolutionary process whereby the structure evolves from a base which is the minimum structural form required to carry the load regardless of the magnitude of the stress levels. Material is added in the proximity of high stress to ameliorate its effect and hence the final structural form emerges. Only singly connected regions are formed in the present analysis and thus the additive ESO process is the opposite of the nibbling SO, mentioned above, that produces optimum surface shapes. The paper presents a brief background to the current state of structural optimisation research. This is followed by a discussion of the strategies for the additive ESO (AESO) algorithm and two examples are presented.},

A formalism for the complete, generative specification of a class of non-representational, geometric paintings or sculptures is defined which has shape grammars as its primary structural component. Paintings are material representations of two-dimensional shapes generated by shape grammars, sculptures of three-dimensional shapes. Implications for aesthetics and design theory in the visual arts are discussed. Aesthetics is considered in terms of specificational simplicity and visual complexity. In design based on generative specifications, the artist chooses structural and material relationships and then determines algorithmically the resulting art objects.},

The potential solution to the RCPSP in view of minimizing project duration is represented by the multidimensional particle, where two solution representations, i.e., priority-based representation and permutation-based representation, are respectively considered. The frameworks of the PSOs for the RCPSP according to the two solution representations are developed. Experimental analyses are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed PSO-based methodology, including comparison of the two representations and comparison with other approaches for the RCPSP. The study aims at providing an alternative means for the RCPSP by utilizing the features of PSO, such as particle-updating mechanism that may benefit from the searching experience of one particle itself or the best of all particles in the swarm. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The term Building Information Model emerged in 1992. It has evolved over time and has its meaning currently associated with an object-oriented modeling technology and an associated set of processes to produce, communicate and analyze building models. Its origin is related to several other, older terms. This paper registers the evolution of BIM and related definitions over time by means of a systematic literature review. We present a list of BIM-related terms and their meanings, organized by date of emergence, and charts showing which ones are most used over time, contributing to better understanding of the meaning of BIM},

abstract = {In groundwater modeling the identification of an optimal flow or transport parameter that varies spatially should include both the values and structure of the parameter. However, most existing techniques for parameter identification only consider the parameter values. In this study, the problem of identifying optimal parameter structure is treated as a large combinatorial optimization problem. Two recently developed heuristic search techniques, simulated annealing and tabu search, are used to solve the large combinatorial optimization problem. The effectiveness and flexibility of these two techniques are evaluated and compared with simple grid search and descent search, using preliminary results from one-dimensional examples. Among the techniques examined in this paper, tabu search performs extremely well in terms of the total number of function evaluations required.},

Using projective geometry, duality theory and linear optimization, it provides a graphical and intuitive method, adopting the same advantages of techniques such as graphic statics, but offering a viable extension to fully three-dimensional problems. The proposed method is applicable for the analysis of vaulted historical structures, specifically in unreinforced masonry, as well as the design of new vaulted structures.

abstract = {Cities worldwide are attempting to transform themselves into smart cities. Recent cases and studies show that a key factor in this transformation is the use of urban big data from stakeholders and physical objects in cities. However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities. This paper will contribute to urban planning and policy development in the modern data-rich economy.},

A new material representation model is developed to implicitly describe material usage in a given design domain in terms of one implicit design variable. Based on the KarushKuhnTucker (KKT) necessary conditions, optimality criteria for finding solutions are established and then employed to develop a simple algorithm for one-material minimum mean compliance and compliant mechanism problems. The algorithm consists of sequentially moving iso-surface threshold (MIST) of chosen characteristic response function. Numerical examples are then presented to validate the proposed algorithm MIST for the minimum mean compliance, compliant mechanism, and fully stressed design problems. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although reliability-based structural optimization (RBSO) is recognized as a rational structural design philosophy that is more advantageous to deterministic optimization, most common RBSO is based on straightforward two-level approach connecting algorithms of reliability calculation and that of design optimization. This is achieved usually with an outer loop for optimization of design variables and an inner loop for reliability analysis. A number of algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computational cost of such optimizations, such as performance measure approach, semi-infinite programming, and mono-level approach. Herein the sequential approximate programming approach, which is well known in structural optimization, is extended as an efficient methodology to solve RBSO problems. In this approach, the optimum design is obtained by solving a sequence of sub-programming problems that usually consist of an approximate objective function subjected to a set of approximate constraint functions. In each sub-programming, rather than direct Taylor expansion of reliability constraints, a new formulation is introduced for approximate reliability constraints at the current design point and its linearization. The approximate reliability index and its sensitivity are obtained from a recurrence formula based on the optimality conditions for the most probable failure point (MPP). It is shown that the approximate MPP, a key component of RBSO problems, is concurrently improved during each sub-programming solution step. Through analytical models and comparative studies over complex examples, it is illustrated that our approach is efficient and that a linearized reliability index is a good approximation of the accurate reliability index. These unique features and the concurrent convergence of design optimization and reliability calculation are demonstrated with several numerical examples.},

@article{Bollmann2013,
abstract = {Generative Architectural Design permits the automatic (or semiautomatic) generation of architectural objects for a wide range of applications, from archaeological research and reconstruction to digital sketching. In this paper the authors introduce design constraint systems (DCS), their approach to the generation of architectural design with the help of a simple example: The development of the necessary formalisms to generate a family of architectural designs, i.e. simple houses and pagodas. After explaining the formal system the authors introduce an approach for the generation of complex form based on the application of transformations and distortions. Architecture is bound by the constraints of physical reality: Gravitation and the properties of the used materials define the limits in which architectural design is possible. With the recent development of new materials and construction methods however, the ways in which form and physics go together get more complicated. As a result, the shapes of architecture gain more liberty, and more and more complex shapes and structures become possible. While these advances allow for new ways of architectural expression, they also make the design process much more challenging. For this reason new tools are necessary for making this complexity manageable for the architect and enable her to play and experiment with the new possibilities of complex shapes and structures. Design constraint systems can be used as tool for experimentation with complex form. Therefore, the authors dedicate the final part of this paper to a concise delineation of an approach for the generation of complex and irregular shapes and structures. While the examples used are simple, they give an idea of the generality of design constraint systems: By using a two-component approach to the generation of designs (the first component describes the abstract structure of the modelled objects while the second component interprets the structure and generates the actual geometric forms) and allowing the user to adjust both components freely, it can be adapted to all kind of different architectural styles, from historical to contemporary architecture.},

abstract = {Evolutionary Topology Optimization of Continuum Structures treads new ground with a comprehensive study on the techniques and applications of evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) and its later version bi-directional ESO (BESO) methods. Since the ESO method was first introduced by Xie and Steven in 1992 and the publication of their well-known book Evolutionary Structural Optimization in 1997, there have been significant improvements in the techniques as well as important practical applications. The authors present these developments, illustrated by numerous interesting and detailed examples. They clearly demonstrate that the evolutionary structural optimization method is an effective approach capable of solving a wide range of topology optimization problems, including structures with geometrical and material nonlinearities, energy absorbing devices, periodical structures, bridges and buildings.Presents latest developments and applications in this increasingly popular {\&} maturing optimization approach for engineers and architects; Authored by leading researchers in the field who have been working in the area of ESO and BESO developments since their conception; Includes a number of test problems for students as well as a chapter of case studies that includes several recent practical projects in which the authors have been involved; Accompanied by a website housing ESO/BESO computer programs at http://www.wiley.com/go/huang  and test examples, as well as a chapter within the book giving a description and step-by-step instruction on how to use the software package BESO2D. Evolutionary Topology Optimization of Continuum Structures will appeal to researchers and graduate students working in structural design and optimization, and will also be of interest to civil and structural engineers, architects and mechanical engineers involved in creating innovative and efficient structures.},

abstract = {In Shape, George Stiny argues that seeing shapes -- with all their changeability and ambiguity -- is an inexhaustible source of creative ideas. Understanding shapes, he says, is a useful way to understand what is possible in design.Shapes are devices for visual expression just as symbols are devices for verbal expression. Stiny develops a unified scheme that includes both visual expression with shapes and verbal expression with signs. The relationships -- and equivalencies -- between the two kinds of expressive devices make design comparable to other professional practices that rely more on verbal than visual expression. Design uses shapes while business, engineering, law, mathematics, and philosophy turn mainly to symbols, but the difference, says Stiny, isn't categorical. Designing is a way of thinking. Designing, Stiny argues, is calculating with shapes, calculating without equations and numbers but still according to rules. Stiny shows that the mechanical process of calculation is actually a creative process when you calculate with shapes -- when you can reason with your eyes, when you learn to see instead of count.The book takes the idea of design as calculation from mere heuristic or metaphor to a rigorous relationship in which design and calculation each inform and enhance the other. Stiny first demonstrates how seeing and counting differ when you use rules -- that is, what it means to calculate with your eyes -- then shows how to calculate with shapes, providing formal details. He gives practical applications in design with specific visual examples. The book is extraordinarily visual, with many drawings throughout -- drawings punctuated with words. You have to see this book in order to read it.},

abstract = {Mobile robots require object detection and classification for safe and smooth navigation. Stereo vision improves such detection by doubling the views of the scene and by giving indirect access to depth information. This depth information can also be used to reduce the set of candidate detection windows. Up to now, most algorithms compute a depth map to discard unpromising detection windows. We propose a novel approach where a stixel world model is computed directly from the stereo images, without computing an intermediate depth map. We experimentally demonstrate that such approach can considerably reduce the set of candidate detection windows at a fraction of the computation cost of previous approaches.},

abstract = {Cloud computing technology is regarded as a major transformational force that is causing unprecedented change across the communication and business disciplines. In the architecture, engineering and construction sector, cloud-BIM integration is considered to be the second generation of building information management (BIM) development, and is expected to produce another wave of change across the construction industry. Despite this, few studies to date have attempted to summarise the research literature on cloud-BIM. This paper explores the literature to identify the substantive work on cloud-BIM, particularly regarding building life cycle management, to provide valuable insight for practitioners and to propose avenues for further research. Thirty academic sources, including refereed journal articles and conference papers, were retrieved and analysed in terms of their research focus and nature of application. The review revealed that most cloud-BIM research has focused on the building planning/design and construction stages. The findings suggest that more research should be directed towards operation, maintenance and facility management, energy efficiency and the demolition and deconstruction stages of building life cycle management. Further empirical research on organisational and legal issues, including security, responsibility, liability and model ownership, of the cloud-BIM model is also needed},

abstract = {The emergence of smart cities aims at mitigating the challenges raised due to the continuous urbanization development and increasing population density in cities. To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.},

abstract = {Technology strategy variables tend to predominate as predictors of survival in the fast-changing rigid disk drive industry. Building on these previous studies, we here test the hypothesis that the technological and market strategies of a new entrant are highly interrelated and that their joint effect plays an important role in a firm's probability of survival. In particular, we propose that firms that target new market segments with an architectural innovation will tend to be more successful than those that target existing markets or innovate in component technology, even after controlling for all the competing predictors of survival. This paper advances the existing literature on innovation by tracing the main technical elements of a dominant design in the rigid disk drive industry over time, and provides a much more rigorous definition of the concept of a dominant design than we have had in the past. We find the notion of first-mover advantage is not applicable in the rigid disk drive industry. Instead, we propose the idea of an entry-window tightly linked to the emergence of the dominant product design as defined.},

However, in practice, most of the GIS models are relatively poorly attributed, semantically. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of building, which is most used in small scale projects. In order to address the target problem of completing the semantic attribution of 3D digital city model, a framework of integrating BIM technology into GIS is demonstrated. A new concept of city information modeling (CIM) is proposed with the goal of bringing great benefits to the urban construction and city management. The composition of city information model is discussed. The data schema behind BIM and GIS (i.e. IFC and CityGML) are compared and mapped with each other. A case study of land planning of campus is demonstrated to present the potential benefits of CIM},

abstract = {The paper proposes a new simulated annealing (SA) based multiobjective optimization algorithm, called orthogonal simulated annealing (OSA) algorithm in this work. The OSA algorithm incorporates an orthogonal experiment design (OED) with a simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithm aiming to provide an efficient multiobjective algorithm. OED involves several experiments based on an orthogonal table and a fractional factorial analysis to extract intelligently the best combination of decision vectors making the classical SA to explore search space effectively, to enhance convergence, and to improve quality of solutions in the Pareto set. These benefits have been tested by comparing the performance of OSA with one state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (NSGA2) and one classical simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithm (CMOSA) considering multiobjective problems of varying degrees of complexity. The obtained Pareto sets by these three algorithms have been tested using standard methods like measure C, hypervolume comparison, etc. Simulation results show that the performance of and CPU time required by these algorithms are problem dependent, and with some problems, the OSA algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms. In particular, the comparison between OSA and CMOSA suggests that around 70{\%} times OSA outperforms CMOSA and obtains a well diversified set of solutions. In addition, with some problems, OSA captures the Pareto fronts where CMOSA fails. Therefore, the development of OSA is noteworthy, and it provides an additional tool to solve multiobjective optimization problems. ?? Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Genetic Algorithm (GA) is widely adopted in optimization and the improvement of its optimization performance is attracting many researchers' attentions. In solving practical problems in the process of architectural design, the ways of converting design problems into mathematical models that can be addressed by GA are of great significance in achieving final optimal results. However, no such rule that can be applied to such conversion has been developed so far. In general, problems which can be addressed by GA can be divided into combinatorial problems and numerical problems. In this paper, by means of attempting to disintegrate a complicated architectural problem into combinatorial and numerical problems, the author discusses feasibility and practicality of solving these two types of problems simultaneously utilizing GA and discloses both advantages and disadvantages of GA by comparing with other algorithms.},

abstract = {Planning of the built environment requires at least two different levels of planning process and modelling. They can be categorized as city/neighbourhood-scale and building-scale. The typical application for city/neighbourhood-scale is Geographic Information System (GIS) and CityGML for the open source 3D format. Meanwhile, for building-scale, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is used, and IFC format is the open source standard. In this paper, two case studies were presented, including visualization for a web application and input model of the urban microclimate modelling STEVE Tool. We used Autodesk Revit and Graphisoft Archicad in developing the building models as prototype for the transformation testing. The transformation system was developed using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME), by Safe Software. FME allowed us to restructure the data model (IFC) and transform it to the destination data format (CityGML).},

However, issues of adoption and implementation persist, particularly for on-site use of BIM tools in the construction phase. We describe an empirical case-study of the implementation of an innovative ‘Site BIM' system on a major hospital construction project. The main contractor on the project developed BIM-enabled tools to allow site workers using mobile tablet personal computers to access design information and to capture work quality and progress data on-site. Accounts show that ‘Site BIM', while judged to be successful and actively supporting users, was delivered through an exploratory and emergent development process of informal prototyping. Technical IT skills were adopted into the construction project through personal relationships and arrangements rather than formal processes. Implementation was driven by construction project employees rather than controlled centrally by the corporate IT function.},

This paper investigates these questions through a review of five different generative design techniques used in architectural design that includes cellular automata, genetic algorithms, L-systems, shape grammars, and swarm intelligence. Based on the literature on design cognition and the recent theoretical works on digital design thinking, this paper proposes the need for an integrated generative design framework to enhance design exploration support for human designers.

@article{Sonmez2007,
abstract = {The goal of this study is to obtain globally optimum shapes for two-dimensional structures subject to quasi-static loads and restraints. For this purpose a technique is proposed, using which the volume (or weight) of a structure can be minimized. The emphasis is on how one can define the shape precisely, and find a shape that accurately reflects the globally optimum shape. As design constraints, stresses developed in the structure should not exceed the maximum allowable stress, and connectivity of the structure should not be lost during shape changes. Optimization is achieved by a stochastic search algorithm called direct simulated annealing (DSA), which seeks the global minimum through randomly generated configurations. In order to obtain random configurations, a boundary variation technique is used. In this technique, a set of key points is chosen and connected by cubic splines to describe the boundary of the structure. Whenever the positions of the key points are changed in random directions, a new shape is obtained. Thus, coordinates of the key points serve as design variables. In order to apply the optimization procedure, a general computer code was developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language. A number of cases were examined to test its effectiveness. The results show that this technique can be applied to two-dimensional shape optimization problems with high reliability even for cases where the entire free boundary is allowed to vary. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Progress in this direction would be aided by the ability to effectively reuse and integrate existing computational models of urban systems. Building on the concept of multi-model ecologies, this paper describes ongoing efforts to facilitate model reuse and integration in the Holistic Urban Energy Simulation (HUES) platform - an extendable simulation environment for the study of urban multi-energy systems. We describe the design and development of a semantic wiki as part of the HUES platform. The purpose of this wiki is to enable the sharing and navigation of model metadata – essential information about the models and datasets of the platform. Each model and dataset in the platform is represented in the wiki in a structured way to facilitate the identification of opportunities for model reuse and integration. As the platform grows, this will help to ensure that it develops coherently and makes efficient use of existing formalized knowledge. We present the core concepts of multi-model ecologies and semantic wikis, the current state of the platform and associated wiki, and a case study demonstrating their use and benefit.},

Then we describe the representation of S-expressions in the memory of the IBM 704 by list structures similar to those used by Newell, Shaw and Simon, and the representation of S-functions by program. Then we mention the main features of the LISP programming system for the IBM 704. Next comes another way of describing computations with symbolic expressions, and finally we give a recursive function interpretation of flow charts. We hope to describe some of the symbolic computations for which LISP has been used in another paper, and also to give elsewhere some applications of our recursive function formalism to mathematical logic and to the problem of mechanical theorem proving.},

Together with the technique of feature based modelling, modelling with constraints has widely affected the development of new CAD-systems. The architecture of so called parametric CAD-systems reflects the impact of these new technologies. Besides the new hybrid modellers of geometry and topology, the sketcher and the constraint solver have become key components in a parametric CAD-system. The sketcher may be regarded as a designer interface for modelling with constraints. Moreover rule-based methods of automatic constraint detection are applied in sketchers. Constraint solvers evaluate the network of constraints formulated by the sketcher as a set of equations or predicates using numeric or symbolic algorithms or rule based approaches. The article closes with a summary of the advantages and risks of designing with constraints, showing typical application fields of this modelling technique and discussing some open issues.},

The first step in implementing genetic algorithms is to define a representation, that is, the data structure representative of the genotype space and its mathematical relation to the data of the phenotype space - the variables of the real problem. This can be a hard task, particularly if the design system contains dependency between variables. This paper presents a general representation, which enables the use of standard variation operators, allows defining both continuous and discrete variables from a single type of gene and is easily adaptable to different problems, with a larger or smaller number of variables. This representation was created to solve the representation problem in the design system for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses, a shape grammar that was converted into a parametric design system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract The European {\{}COST{\}} Sub-Urban Action (TU1206) has had the fundamental aim of closing the knowledge gap between subsurface experts and potential users of subsurface knowledge - urban decision- makers, practitioners and researchers. The Action assembled a network involving {\textgreater}30 countries, 23 actively participating cities, researchers, practitioners and urban decision-makers, and brought together the fragmented research and good practice across Europe in sustainable urban sub-surface use. Development of national exemplars has been encouraged, and good practice identified to inspire others, using a lighthouse-follower approach to cascade knowledge and good practice across Europe and further afield. Experts from both sides of the knowledge gap were brought together to assess and synthesise the state-of-the-art in lighthouse cities with respect to urban sub-surface knowledge, understanding, and use of that knowledge. This was achieved in 19 City Studies, with findings encapsulated in an over-view report “Out of Sight - Out of Mind”. Expert sub-groups then identified good practice in subsurface data and knowledge locally, nationally, and Europe-wide. These are highlighted in the synthesis report “Opening up the subsurface for the cities of tomorrow”, and expanded on in seven topic review reports. These also identified key gaps in knowledge, and its use. A new concept, {\{}GEOCIM{\}} is proposed for City Quarter to Conurbation scales, combining subsurface and above-ground models. These enable: a.) holistic urban planning; b.) identifying subsurface opportunities; and c.) saving costs by reducing uncertainty in ground conditions. Finally, the Action's reports and outputs were integrated within an online toolbox, and will be further outlined in the Final Report of the Action, to be made available on the Action's website. The Sub-Urban Toolbox promotes and disseminates the good practice, and decision-support tools: a.) to help better inform and empower city decision- and policy-makers about the sub-surface and the vital importance of its early-stage consideration; and b.) accelerate uptake amongst sub-surface experts of sub-surface modelling workflows. Users with different backgrounds and needs, require different access to, and appropriate translations of, the Sub-Urban Toolbox. Therefore different entry points are provided for sub-surface technical experts, and urban planners, and decision- and policy-makers. As the critical mass of city decision- and policy-makers that is better aware of the sub-surface and its sustainable use expands, the potential for higher level policy consideration of the subsurface grows, and a wider range of impacts will become achievable.},

abstract = {This paper examines the role of computers in the provision of information for architectural design decision making and compares the potential contributions of simulation, generation and optimization techniques. It argues that optimization models are particularly well suited to the provision of design information because they produce results which are prescriptive, express design options and address the problems of the stability and sensitivity of solutions to changes over time. The difficulties posed by the multiple objectives which characterize architectural design problems are discussed and some solution approaches are described. The paper concludes that optimization concepts offer a powerful approach to design decision making and warrant much more research activity in the development of techniques and models for application in architecture.},

abstract = {Construction site layout planning has been recognized as a critical step in construction planning. The basic function of this process is to find the best arrangement of the temporary facilities according to multiple objectives that may conflict with each other and subjected to logical and resource constraints. The formulation of the construction site layout planning problem as an optimization problem turns out to be a nonlinear programming problem where there are conflicting multi-objectives to be achieved. It is shown that the swarm intelligence based meta-heuristic algorithms are quite powerful in obtaining the solution of such hard to solve type of optimization problems. In this study a multi objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) via Levy flights algorithm is proposed to determine the optimum construction site layout. The model is intended to optimize the dynamic layout of unequal-area under two objective functions. The performance of MOABC with Levy flights is demonstrated on a real benchmark construction engineering of construction site layout planning problem and the optimum solution obtained is compared with the one determined by the ant colony algorithm.},

abstract = {Environmental sustainable development has become an important goal of construction progress, and waste management is one of the key links in construction. Although many policies in China have been issued to promote construction waste management, unfortunately there is no significant effect, and the key is lack of a quantitative evaluation system and guidance on management level. Based on the domestic and foreign relevant experiences, this paper puts forward a new system to evaluate waste management performance in an architectural engineering project. Through research, main influence factors of construction waste management in our country are confirmed, namely: “commitment of contractor's representative on site; collecting packed materials back by suppliers; minimizing rework in the construction phase; design and construction using standardized materials; and appointment of laborers solely for waste disposal”. Through four construction cases in the Pearl River Delta with the application of performance assessment model of waste management in architectural engineering projects, it is proved that the model can effectively measure the waste management performance in construction site, with clearer responsibilities and higher performance. Finally, it is suggested that our government should assess waste management performance in construction site pertinently, develop market assessment software actively, and promote the environmental sustainable development of architectural industry.},

abstract = {Spatial allocation is the process of assigning different attributes (e.g., land-use or land-cover) to spatial entities (e.g., map polygons or grid cells). It is an exercise that often requires the analysis of multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives. Multi-objective spatial allocation problems often exhibit substantial computational complexity, especially when spatial pattern characteristics are specified as the allocation objectives. Optimization techniques that incorporate heuristics or knowledge-informed rules have been found to be more effective in solving spatial allocation problem. In this article, we (1) develop and demonstrate a knowledge-informed Pareto simulated annealing approach to tackle specifically multi-objective allocation problems that consider spatial patterns as objectives and (2) determine whether the knowledge-informed approach is more effective than standard Pareto simulation annealing in solving multi-objective spatial allocation problems. Four multi-objective spatial allocation problems were formulated in a gridded two-dimensional discrete space to benchmark the performance of our knowledge-informed algorithms and a standard Pareto simulated annealing algorithm. These four problems, each with two objectives, represent all combinations of cases in which there are (1) conflicting or concordant objectives and (2) two pattern objectives or one pattern objective and one non-pattern objective, representing objectives with similar or different degrees of difficulty. We generated 1200 sets of solutions, represented as allocation maps. Performance indices that measure the computational effectiveness and efficiency were developed for evaluation. The results suggest that the solutions generated by the knowledge-informed approach are more effective in approximating the set of Pareto optimal solutions than those generated by the standard Pareto simulated annealing.},

This paradigm shift has also set up new expectations on college students for their competencies in sustainability and BIM. While most higher education institutions have already incorporated such topics in their curricula, green building and BIM are typically taught separately. In this study, instructors from two classes adopted an integrated approach and designed a joint course project focusing on both sustainable design and BIM implementation. With BIM facilitation, students collaborated in teams working on artefacts and other tasks to accomplish predefined sustainable goals for a real building project. The project based learning provides an ideal framework to evaluate critical factors that influence the execution of BIM in green building project delivery. Formative and summative assessments of student learning outcomes in model communication, teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving, and sustainability were conducted. The results of this study provide insight into innovative pedagogic design for sustainability and BIM education in the AEC curricula. The study also confirmed the effectiveness of project based learning in cultivating student competencies in critical thinking and problem-solving within a multidisciplinary project environment.},

Even if sophisticated search algorithms play an important role in solving constraint-based models, the real power engine behind CP is called constraint propagation (domain filtering, pruning or consistency techniques). In the paper we give a survey of common consistency techniques for binary constraints. We describe the main ideas behind them, list their advantages and limitations, and compare their pruning power. Then we briefly explain how these techniques can be extended to non-binary constraints. Last part of the paper is devoted to modelling issues. We give some hints how the constraint propagation can be exploited more when solving real-life problems. This part is based on our experience with solving real-life programs and it is also supported by empirical observations of other researchers.},

abstract = {The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the high dynamical nature of smart cities calls for new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed the light on the challenge of under utilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. Especially, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart city to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstractions. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data while a larger amount is without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. This paper also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.},

While a lot of work has already been carried out as to what these technologies will bring in terms of product and process innovation, little has been done on their impact on business models and business model innovation. Yet, history has shown that technological revolution without adequate business model evolution is a pitfall for many businesses. In the case of 3D printing, the matter is further complicated by the fact that adoption of these technologies has occurred in four successive phases (rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, digital manufacturing, home fabrication) that correspond to a different level of involvement of 3D printing in the production process. This article investigates the effect of each phase on the key business model components. While the impact of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling is found to be limited in extent, direct manufacturing and, even more so, home fabrication have the potential to be highly disruptive. While much more value can be created, capturing value can become extremely challenging. Hence, finding a suitable business model is critical. To this respect, this article shows that 3D printing technologies have the potential to change the way business model innovation is carried out, by enabling adaptive business models and by bringing the ‘rapid prototyping' paradigm to business model innovation itself.},

abstract = {The article explores the nature of architectural invention in Indian sacred structures by analyzing a group of eleventh-century sandstone temples in the Karnataka region of southern India. Identifying a variety of experiments in a closely related group, it refutes a commonly held scholarly assumption that Indian temples follow architectural norms ordained by India's religious traditions-an assumption fed by Western definitions of individuality and originality. These Karnataka temples demonstrate that their architects-while mostly unknown-fundamentally changed the formal as well as the conceptual basis of southern architecture they had inherited. Their formal choices, manipulating regional conventions as well as opening up their structures to include references from other regions, led to a new, consciously modern form of architecture whose modernity has been overlooked by scholars. Scholars have tended to call this new regional invention Vesara (Sanskrit "mule" or "hybrid"), defining it as a derivative style of temple created by mixing typical features of North Indian and South Indian architecture. The article traces the emergence of Vesara's conceptual logic in the eleventh century through architectural anomalies and daringly unprecedented play with the formal means of regional architecture, arguing that the makers of these temples exercised a level of inventiveness we have not been willing to credit them with so far.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to reflect on the use of the parametric modeling in two didactic experiences. The first experiment involved resources of the Paracloud program and its relation with the Rhinoceros program, that resulted in the production of physical models produced with the aid of the laser cutting. In the second experiment, the students had produced algorithms in the Grasshopper, resulting in families of structures and coverings. The study objects are both the physical models and digital algorithms resultants from this experimentation. For the analysis and synthesis of the results, we adopted four important assumptions: 1. the value of attitudes and environment of work; 2. the importance of experimentation and improvisation; 3. understanding of the design process as a situated act and as a ill-defined problem; 4. the inclusion of creative and critical thought in the disciplines. The results allow us to affirm that the parametric modeling stimulates creativity, therefore allowing combination of different parameters, that result in unexpected discoveries.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nKeywords: Teach-Learning, Parametric Modeling, Laser Cutter, Grasshopper, Design Process, Creativity.},

abstract = {3D geo-database research is a promising field to support challenging applications such as 3D urban planning, environmental monitoring, infrastructure management, and early warning or disaster management and response. In these fields, interdisciplinary research in GIScience and related fields is needed to support the modelling, analysis, management, and integration of large geo-referenced data sets, which describe human activities and geophysical phenomena. Geo-databases may serve as platforms to integrate 2D maps, 3D geo-scientific models, and other geo-referenced data. However, current geo-databases do not provide sufficient 3D data modelling and data handling techniques. New 3D geo-databases are needed to handle surface and volume models. This article first presents a 25-year retrospective of geo-database research. Data modelling, standards, and indexing of geo-data are discussed in detail. New directions for the development of 3D geo-databases to open new fields for interdisciplinary research are addressed. Two scenarios in the fields of early warning and emergency response demonstrate the combined management of human and geophysical phenomena. The article concludes with a critical outlook on open research problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Lamberti2008,
abstract = {This paper presents an optimization algorithm based on Simulated Annealing. The algorithm – denoted as CMLPSA (Corrected Multi-Level {\&} Multi-Point Simulated Annealing) – implements an advanced search mechanism where each candidate design is selected from a population of trial points randomly generated. Therefore, CMLPSA is in principle similar to meta-heuristic algorithms dealing with a pool/population of designs rather than with a single trial point such as it is usually done in classical simulated annealing. The multi-point strategy is adopted for both feasible and infeasible intermediate designs. In the former case, perturbations given to optimization variables are forced to follow the current rate of change exhibited by the cost function. In the latter case, 4th order approximate line search is performed in the neighbourhood of each feasible trial point generated in the current annealing cycle. Furthermore, CMLPSA includes a multi-level annealing strategy where trial points are generated by perturbing all design variables simultaneously (global level) or one by one (local level). Global or local search is performed basing on the current trend seen in the optimization process. CMLPSA is tested in six structural optimization problems where the objective is to minimize the weight of bar trusses – with up to 200 elements – subject to constraints on nodal displacements, member stresses and critical buckling loads. Test cases include both sizing and lay-out optimization variables. The computationally most expensive problem has 200 design variables and 3500 optimization constraints. CMLPSA is compared with other state-of-the-art SA algorithms and advanced global optimization methods like Heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO) and Harmony Search (HS) recently presented in literature. Numerical results clearly demonstrate efficiency and robustness of CMLPSA. In particular, CMLPSA found better designs than the other SA-based algorithms and converged much more quickly to the optimum than HPSO and HS. Furthermore, CMLPSA is insensitive to initial design.},

abstract = {In extremely hot and dry climates, like northwestern Mexico, solar gain reduction in houses using solar passive techniques is important for improving comfort inside the construction and to save costs in electrical cooling during the whole year, because the winter season is also hot in those regions. A new one-dimension method is proposed to analyze the interaction between two common shading devices: awnings and external walls to reduce insulation on the facade and inside the house due to fenestration. The method is demonstrated by optimizing a typical dwelling with an azimuth of 90° (east), which, achieves 45{\%} reduction in direct solar insulation during the summer solstice on the profile of the facade.

abstract = {Much interest has been recently devoted to generative processes in design. Advances in computational tools for design applications, coupled with techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, have lead to new possibilities in the way computers can inform and actively interact with the design process. In this paper, we use the concepts of generative and goal-oriented design to propose a computer tool that can help the designer to generate and evaluate certain aspects of a solution towards an optimized behavior of the final configuration. This work focuses mostly on those aspects related to the environmental performance of buildings. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied as a generative and search procedure to look for optimized design solutions in terms of thermal and lighting performance in a building. The GA is first used to generate possible design solutions, which are then evaluated in terms of lighting and thermal behavior using a detailed thermal analysis program (DOE2.1E). The results from the simulations are subsequently used to further guide the GA search towards finding low-energy solutions to the problem under study. Solutions can be visualized using an AutoLisp routine. The specific problem addressed in this study is the placing and sizing of windows in an office building. The same method is applicable to a wide range of design problems like the choice of construction materials, design of shading elements, or sizing of lighting and mechanical systems for buildings. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

First, we wish to bring to the attention of the Industrial Engineering community a challenging industrial problem, black-box structural design, which cannot currently be satisfactorily addressed by professional software for topology optimization. The constraint functions considered here are non-linear and implicit, their evaluation requires the resolution of a computation-intensive finite-element analysis performed by a black-box commercial structural mechanics software such as MSC/Nastran. We present here a brief overview of topology optimization methods. Secondly, we propose a practical topology design heuristic methodology for handling such problems, which includes a new interpolation scheme for the fictive-material SIMP model.

abstract = {Graphical statics is an almost forgotten, intuitive drawing method for solving plane mechanical problems. It was already in use in the 19th century for biomechanical problems. It was still a standard method employed by civil engineers in the 1940s. Superceded by modern analytical methods, graphical statics disappeared almost completely. The method is restricted to plane static problems, but still remains a useful tool for visualizing, understanding and checking the actions of force groups occurring in modern biomechanical problems. After defining the basic mechanical terminology (body, motion, forces), the paper is written mainly as a teaching tool for immediate application. Many illustrative examples (sporting activities, functional forces in joints) help to clarify the difficult biomechanical content. For application, it must be assumed that the bodies investigated behave as rigid bodies under the action of the forces, but this does not prevent application of the method to deformable living bodies if specific static configurations of the bodies are considered. The application of the method requires a good anatomical knowledge and experience with the function of the musculo-skeletal apparatus of living bodies. If reliable models are used, the method delivers quantitative results of sufficient accuracy. The paper may also help provide a better understanding of publications containing graphical solutions to bio-static problems. Die graphische Statik ist eine fast vergessene, intuitive zeichnerische Methode zur L{\"{o}}sung von mechanischen Problemen in einer Ebene. Sie wurde bereits im 19. Jahrhundert f{\"{u}}r biomechanische Probleme verwendet. Noch in den 40er Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts war sie eine von Bauingenieuren angewendete Standardmethode. Abgel{\"{o}}st von modernen analytischen Methoden, verschwand die graphische Statik fast vollst{\"{a}}ndig. Die Methode ist auf ebene Statikprobleme beschr{\"{a}}nkt, aber sie ist immer noch ein n{\"{u}}tzliches Werkzeug zur Veranschaulichung, zum Verst{\"{a}}ndnis und zur Kontrolle der Wirkung von Kr{\"{a}}ftegruppen, die bei modernen biomechanischen Problemen auftreten. Im Anschluss an die Definition der grundlegenden mechanischen Terminologie (K{\"{o}}rper, Bewegung, Kr{\"{a}}fte) ist der Artikel haupts{\"{a}}chlich als Lehrmittel zur unmittelbaren Anwendung gedacht. Zahlreiche Anschauungsbeispiele (sportliche Aktivit{\"{a}}ten, funktionelle Kr{\"{a}}fte in Gelenken) helfen bei der Erkl{\"{a}}rung des schwierigen biomechanischen Inhalts. F{\"{u}}r die Anwendung muss davon ausgegangen werden, dass die zu erforschenden K{\"{o}}rper sich unter der Kr{\"{a}}fteeinwirkung wie starre K{\"{o}}rper verhalten, was jedoch die Anwendung der Methode auf verformbare lebendige K{\"{o}}rper nicht ausschliesst, wenn spezifische statische Konfigurationen der K{\"{o}}rper ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden. Die Anwendung der Methode erfordert gute anatomische Kenntnisse und Erfahrung mit der Funktionsweise der Skelettmuskulatur lebender K{\"{o}}rper. Wenn zuverl{\"{a}}ssige Modelle verwendet werden, liefert die Methode ausreichend exakte quantitative Resultate. Der Artikel kann ebenfalls zu einem besseren Verst{\"{a}}ndnis von Ver{\"{o}}ffentlichungen mit graphischen L{\"{o}}sungen von bio-statischen Problemen beitragen. La statique graphique, une m{\'{e}}thode intuitive largement oubli{\'{e}}e, permet la r{\'{e}}solution de probl{\`{e}}mes de m{\'{e}}canique bidimensionnelle. Utilis{\'{e}}e d{\`{e}}s le XIXe si{\`{e}}cle en biom{\'{e}}canique, elle est toujours employ{\'{e}}e en g{\'{e}}nie civil dans les ann{\'{e}}es 40 comme m{\'{e}}thode standard. Mais, avec le d{\'{e}}veloppement de m{\'{e}}thodes analytiques modernes, la statique graphique est tomb{\'{e}}e dans l'oubli. Bien qu'applicable qu'aux probl{\`{e}}mes statiques bidimensionnelles, elle reste un outil int{\'{e}}ressant pour mieux visualiser, comprendre et valider les actions de groupes de forces rencontr{\'{e}}s dans les probl{\`{e}}mes modernes de biom{\'{e}}canique. Apr{\`{e}}s avoir d{\'{e}}fini les termes m{\'{e}}caniques appropri{\'{e}}s (corps, mouvement, force), cet article se pr{\'{e}}sente principalement comme un outil de formation permettant une application imm{\'{e}}diate. Plusieurs exemples (activit{\'{e}}s sportives, forces fonctionnelles articulaires) illustrent sa capacit{\'{e}}{\`{a}}rendre plus lisible des probl{\`{e}}mes de biom{\'{e}}canique complexe. Lorsqu'on applique cette m{\'{e}}thode, on accepte l'hypoth{\`{e}}se que les corps{\'{e}}tudi{\'{e}}s et soumis{\`{a}}une force agissent en tant que corps rigides. Ceci n'est pas en contradiction avec son application aux corps vivants d{\'{e}}formables si l'on{\'{e}}tudie leurs configurations statiques sp{\'{e}}cifiques. La m{\'{e}}thode demande une bonne connaissance de l'anatomie fonctionnelle de l'appareil locomoteur des corps vivants. En se servant de mod{\`{e}}les fiables, elle permet l'acquisition de donn{\'{e}}es quantitatives d'une pr{\'{e}}cision satisfaisante. Le but de cet article est de favoriser une meilleure compr{\'{e}}hension des publications pr{\'{e}}sentant des solutions graphiques de probl{\`{e}}mes de biom{\'{e}}canique statique. La est{\'{a}}tica gr{\'{a}}fica es un m{\'{e}}todo de dibujo intuitivo, casi olvidado, para resolver problemas mec{\'{a}}nicos en el plano. Ya se utilizaba en el siglo XIX para los problemas biomec{\'{a}}nicos. En los an˜os cuarenta era todav{\'{i}}a el m{\'{e}}todo est{\'{a}}ndar utilizado por los ingenieros civiles. Sustituida por los m{\'{e}}todos anal{\'{i}}ticos modernos, la est{\'{a}}tica gr{\'{a}}fica desapareci{\'{o}}casi por completo. El m{\'{e}}todo ha quedado limitado a problemas est{\'{a}}ticos en el plano pero sigue siendo una herramienta{\'{u}}til a la hora de visualizar, entender y verificar las acciones de grupos de fuerzas que se dan en los problemas biomec{\'{a}}nicos modernos. Tras definir la terminolog{\'{i}}a mec{\'{a}}nica b{\'{a}}sica (cuerpo, movimiento, fuerzas), el trabajo se ha escrito principalmente a modo de herramienta de ensen˜anza para aplicaci{\'{o}}n inmediata. La inclusi{\'{o}}n de muchos ejemplos ilustrativos (actividades deportivas, fuerzas funcionales en las articulaciones) ayudan a aclarar el dif{\'{i}}cil contenido biomec{\'{a}}nico. Para su aplicaci{\'{o}}n, es necesario asumir que los cuerpos investigados se comportan como cuerpos r{\'{i}}gidos bajo la acci{\'{o}}n de las fuerzas, pero esto no implica que no pueda aplicarse el m{\'{e}}todo a cuerpos vivos deformables siempre que se consideren configuraciones est{\'{a}}ticas espec{\'{i}}ficas de estos cuerpos. La aplicaci{\'{o}}n del m{\'{e}}todo requiere poseer un buen conocimiento anat{\'{o}}mico y experiencia en el funcionamiento del aparato musculoesquel{\'{e}}tico de los cuerpos vivos. Si se utilizan modelos fiables, el m{\'{e}}todo proporciona unos resultados cuantitativos de una precisi{\'{o}}n suficiente. Este trabajo puede tambi{\'{e}}n ayudar a la comprensi{\'{o}}n de publicaciones que contienen soluciones gr{\'{a}}ficas a problemas bioest{\'{a}}ticos.},

abstract = {Why does the word design owe its origin to Latin and not Greek roots? Where do the limits of the human mind lie? How does ambiguity enter the deterministic world of computation? Who was Parmenides and why is his philosophy still puzzling today? This unique volume challenges the reader to tackle all these complex questions and more.Algorithmic Architecture is not a typical theory-based architectural book; it is not a computer programming or language tutorial book either. It contains a series of provocative design projects, and yet it is not just a design or graphic art book per se. Following the tradition of architecture as a conglomeration of various design fields - engineering, theory, art, and recently, computation - the challenge of this book is to present a concept that, like architecture, is a unifying theme for many diverse disciplines. An algorithm is not only a step-by-step problem-solving procedure, a series of lines of computer codes or a mechanistic linguistic expression, but is also an ontological construct with deep philosophical, social, design, and artistic repercussions. Consequently, this book presents many, various and often seemingly disparate points of view that lead to the establishment of one common theme; algorithmic architecture. Guides readers in the increasingly popular practice of using algorithms to solve complex design issues Demonstrates a technique used by many of the big name architecture firms, now cascading down to educational level Shows architects how to use algorithms to go beyond the mouse and transcend the factory set limitations of current 3D CAD software},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to address the problem in research of a lack of a holistic conceptual framework related to incremental and discontinuous innovation. Too often, the term “innovation” is used without an understanding of how it can be applied in a product design and supply chain fulfillment system. In this study, the goal is to develop a holistic “innovation continuum” to treat innovation as a complex adaptive system (CAS). Design/methodology/approach – A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and from it, four propositions and a conceptual framework were developed. Findings – The authors determined that an “innovation continuum” can be established through the use of a complex adaptive system. Two, incremental innovation is determined to possess adaptive qualities, and can be enhanced through the use of collaboration and evolutionary algorithms. Three, discontinuous innovation is established as a creative process enabled through expert designers, and improved through the use of generative design. Next, a supply chain system for incremental innovation can be assisted by the use of adaptive systems, but it is not proven that a generative customization system (for discontinuous innovation) can be improved through the use of a CAS. Originality/value – The paper has established an “innovation continuum” linking incremental and discontinuous innovation within one holistic system. It establishes the use of evolutionary algorithms to improve the viability of incremental innovation, and generative design for discontinuous innovation. Finally, the concept of generative customization as an end to end product design and supply chain fulfillment solution for discontinuous innovation is established.},

abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is the digital representation of physical and functional characteristics (such as geometry, spatial relationship, and geographic information) of a facility to support decisions during its life cycle. BIM has been extended beyond 3D geometrical representations in recent years, and now includes time as a fourth dimension and cost as a fifth dimension, as well as such other applications as virtual reality and augmented reality. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly applied in various products (smart homes, wearables) to enhance work productivity, living comfort, and entertainment. However, research addressing the integration of these two technologies (BIM and IoT) is still very limited, and has focused exclusively on the automatic transmission of sensor information to BIM models. This paper describes an attempt to represent and visualize sensor data in BIM with multiple perspectives in order to support complex decisions requiring interdisciplinary information. The study uses a university campus as an example and includes several scenarios, such as an auditorium with a dispersed audience and energy-saving options for rooms with different functions (mechanical/electrical equipment, classrooms, and laboratory). This paper also discusses the design of a common platform allowing communication among sensors with different protocols (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), the use of Dynamo to accept sensor data as input and automatically redraw visualized information in BIM, and how visualization may help in making energy-saving management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

Users can retrieve alternatives from the gallery, share them with others, and combine them to generate more alternatives. We evaluated this system qualitatively in a workshop with ten expert designers working on their own design problems. We learnt that users prefer the gallery to their accustomed workarounds.

abstract = {Computers have now become a crucial component in the process of digital media contents creation. Computer programs have been written to generate artistic artifacts, for examples, poetry, painting and music. These artifacts could be classified along the spectrum of algorithmic complexity of the programs, where order is at one end and disorder is at the other end. The artifacts classified toward the order end of the spectrum possess a clear structure (e.g., symmetry and tiling) while the artifacts classified toward the disorder end do not have any structure at both local and global levels (e.g., randomisation). Highly ordered or disordered generative art artifacts are generated from efficient algorithms that are simpler than those used to generate artifacts classified as lying between the order and disorder extremes. Control is embedded in the programs and it expresses the intention and strategy of the creative process. In this paper, we investigate the issue of control in generative art. We argue that the control expressed in the programs is a crucial component in a generative process. Hence, the ability to exert control is important in guiding the creative processes to intentionally generate complex and interesting artifacts. We describe the nature of the control observed in the generative process of computer generative art techniques. We then present examples of computer generated painting and discuss the control employed in the generative processes. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The facility layout problem is concerned with finding the optimal facility arrangement in the existing layout. From many artificial intelligence searching methods, the tabu search is widely applied to the optimization problems. In this paper, the efficient strategies of tabu search algorithm have been developed to improve the layout in the facility layout problem. In order to improve the layout results, the strategies in the different intensification and diversification procedures are proposed in this study. The algorithm shows the rapid convergence of searching to solve the facility layout arrangement. A comparison was also presented to demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies of tabu search in optimization. The results show that the proposed multi-searching strategies can effectively improve the search of various constructive heuristics and outperform the existing heuristics for the well-known facility layout problems.},

abstract = {The structure–property relationships in newly developed polymer micro-truss structures were investigated, correlating compressive behavior with structural features, including density, cell size and truss angle. These open-cellular polymer micro-truss structures were formed from an interpenetrating array of self-propagating polymer waveguides. Compression experiments verified that the effective modulus scaled linearly with the measured relative density of the micro-trusses and was reliably predicted from a simple analytical model. However, the measured peak strength at initial truss member buckling was well below the values predicted from inelastic buckling theory, which was attributed to imperfections in the structure and the nonlinear compressive behavior of the solid polymer. In addition, a micro-truss structure was post cured at a higher temperature in an oxidizing environment which suppressed the tendency for truss members to prematurely buckle. The polymer modulus increased by approximately 40{\%} and the peak strength of the micro-truss structure nearly doubled to 5.9MPa.},

We explain how a structure, for instance a bar and joint struc- ture, can fail to be rigid for two quite different types of reasons. First, it may not have enough bars connecting certain sets of nodes. That is, it may faij for topological reasons. Secondly,. although it may “count” correctly, it may still fail to be rigid if it is set up with some special relative positions of its nodes and bars; This second type of failure is a question not of topology but of projective geometry.},

abstract = {Combinatorial optimization problems are encountered in many areas of science and engineering. Most of these problems are too difficult to be solved optimally, and hence heuristics are used to obtain "good" solutions in reasonable time. One heuristic that has been successfully applied to a variety of problems is Simulated Annealing. The performance of Simulated Annealing depends on the appropriate choice of a key parameter, the annealing schedule. Researchers usually experiment with some manually created annealing schedules and then use the one that performs best in their algorithms. This work replaces this manual search by Genetic Programming, a method based on natural evolution. We demonstrate the potential of this new approach by optimizing the annealing schedule for a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, the Quadratic Assignment Problem. We introduce two new algorithms for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem that perform extremely well and outperform existing Simulated Annealing algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and finite element analysis are employed in topology optimization of 2D and 3D structural models. The aim is to find the stiffest structure with a certain amount of material, based on the element's contribution to the strain energy. The ACO algorithm provides a suitable tool to handle the problem as an on-off discrete optimization. In this method, the analogy with ants determining the shortest path to food is the decision for an element to be eliminated or to remain. The main effect of using this approach lies in the fact that the problems of topology optimization can be reformulated as discrete problems with no limitation. Examples of 2D and 3D models are provided to show the applicability of the present method. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Architectural prototyping is the process of using executable code to investigate stakeholders' software architecture concerns with respect to a system under development. Previous work has established this as a useful and cost-effective way of exploration and learning of the design space of a system and in addressing issues regarding quality attributes, architectural risks, and the problem of knowledge transfer and conformance. However, the actual industrial use of architectural prototyping has not been thoroughly researched so far. In this article, we report from three studies of architectural prototyping in practice. First, we report findings from an ethnographic study of practicing software architects. Secondly, we report from a focus group on architectural prototyping involving architects from four companies. And, thirdly, we report from a survey study of 20 practicing software architects and software developers. Our findings indicate that architectural prototyping plays an important and frequent role in resolving problems experimentally, but less so in exploring alternative solutions. Furthermore, architectural prototypes include end-user or business related functionality rather than purely architectural functionality. Based on these observations we provide recommendations for effective industrial architectural prototyping.},

abstract = {4D modeling has been an applied research area for around two decades since the first seminal works in the nineties. In the last years, a number of case studies have been published both for demonstrating the various applications of 4D and for assessing technological propositions. However, in most papers only little place is given to the particular content of 4D models. In parallel, following the growing implementation of Building Information Modeling, 4D modeling process is usually recognized as a “BIM use”. In BIM implementations and protocols, the Level Of Development of datasets is a fundamental issue. This paper describes the application of two distinct “4D uses” conducted on a single pilot project. They aim to assess the levels of graphical and temporal details required for the implemented uses. The authors finally discuss the diversity of 4D uses with 4D models, both planned or ad-hoc, as well as the logical understanding related to 4D LOD.},

The phenomenon of envelope creation appears in the early stages of the architectural design. Variables that influence the final shape and size of such envelopes are then identified. This paper presents the state-of-the-art tools for the current solutions at the commercial and academic/scientific level. The variables identified in this research are the client's needs, the urban code and architectural practice, and their specific components for the final creation of a new decision support system tool based on the building information modeling (BIM) software platform, to facilitate the work in the project development and drawing production stages. This tool generates several options for building envelopes according to the parameters required by the city Zoning Planning Commission. These options then lead to deliver reliable data and a geometry that can be analyzed in a timely fashion by the engineers, builders, architects, government, and clients in the early stages of the building's design. The results show that use of specific information and communication technologies (ICT) tools in the early stages of a building design helps reduce the working time, increases confidence in the generated solution, and contributes to the exploration of alternatives in a short period of time.},

The advantages of this method over known approaches are discussed, with an application on a recent live project also described. A real-time solver using semi-implicit Euler integration with viscous damping is used to achieve system equilibrium. By using a real-time solver, the designer is able to alter the gravitational field or apply new point loads without re-starting the analysis, leading to a interactive experience in generating design options. The successful application of the method on a recent project is also discussed.},

Therefore, it is left to the application developers to handle the details of change such that the system's consistency is not jeopardized. Objective: We aim to change the status quo by providing the middleware facilities necessary to ensure the consistency of software after adaptation. We would like these facilities to be reusable across different applications, such that the middleware can streamline the process of achieving safe adaptation. Method: Our approach addresses the current shortcomings by utilizing the information encoded in a software system's architectural style. This information drives the development of reusable adaptation patterns. The patterns specify both the exact sequence of changes and the time at which those changes need to occur. We use the patterns to provide advanced adaptation support on top of an existing architectural middleware platform. Results: Our experience shows the feasibility of deriving detailed adaptation patterns for several architectural styles. Applying the middleware to adapt two real-world software systems shows the approach is effective in consistently adapting these systems without jeopardizing their consistency. Conclusion: We conclude the approach is effective in alleviating the application developers from the responsibility of managing the adaptation process at the application-level. Moreover, we believe this study provides the foundation for changing the way adaptation support is realized in middleware solutions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the design of efficient geometric multigrid methods on hierarchical triangular grids using a three-coarsening strategy. In [F.J. Gaspar, J.L. Gracia, F.J. Lisbona, Fourier analysis for multigrid methods on triangular grids, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., in press], a Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) for multigrid methods with standard coarsening on triangular grids has been proposed. It is based on an expression of the Fourier transform in new coordinate systems. LFA is applied to the new coarsening strategy to design components for an efficient multigrid algorithm. The definition of low and high frequencies, and therefore the spaces of harmonics, are adapted according to the new situation. Appropriate smoothing methods, in particular a three-color smoother with optimal relaxation parameter, are proposed and analyzed for the discrete Laplace operator obtained with linear finite elements. Moreover, special inter-grid transfer operators are designed. These methods are compared with standard coarsening algorithms in terms of the computational work required. Independently of the shape of the triangles, we show that the three-coarsening strategy is a good computational alternative to standard coarsening.},

abstract = {Elements that constitute the built environment are vast and so are the independent systems developed to model its various aspects. Many of these systems have been developed under various assumptions and approaches to execute functions that are distinct, complementary or sometimes similar. Furthermore, these systems are ever increasing in number and often assume similar nomenclatures and acronyms, thereby exacerbating the challenges of understanding their peculiar functions, definitions and differences. The current societal demand to improve sustainability per­formance through collaboration as well as whole-system and through-life thinking is driving the need to integrate independent systems associated with different aspects and scales of the built environment to deliver smart solutions and services that improve the well-being of citizens. The contemporary object-oriented digitization of real-world elements appears to provide a leeway for amalgamating the modelling systems of various domains in the built environment which we termed as built environment information modelling (BeIM). These domains include architecture, engineering, construction as well as urban planning and design. Applications such as building information modelling, geographic information systems and 3D city modelling systems are now being integrated for city modelling purposes. The various works directed at integrating these systems are examined, revealing that current research efforts on integration fall into three categories: (1) data/file conversion systems, (2) semantic mapping systems and (3) the hybrid of both. The review outcome suggests that good knowledge of these domains and how their respective systems operate is vital to pursuing holistic systems integration in the built environment.},

abstract = {Real-world multi-objective engineering design optimization problems often have parameters with uncontrollable variations. The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives: a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions. To illustrate its application, RMOGA is applied to two well-studied engineering design problems from the literature.},

Interval analysis is used in a variety of algorithms to compute solutions to global problems and is an exhaustive technique as all regions of the problem's input space are examined for solutions. Convergent inclusion functions are a useful tool for the analysis of interval algorithms. The number of solutions to the constraint system is assumed to be the number of disjoint sets produced. This technique may be used heuristically or in combination with the condition for existence of a unique zero. A robust approach to the subproblem of obtaining all solutions to the constraint system is to use a robust test for solution existence in each aggregated region. Interval Newton methods are robust methods to find bounds on the set of zeroes of a system of n equations of n variables and are the interval analogs of multidimensional Newton iteration for the simultaneous solution of nonlinear equations.},

abstract = {A construction tree is a set of shape generation processes commonly produced with CAD modelers during a design process of B-Rep objects. However, a construction tree does not bring all the desired properties in many configurations: dimension modifications, idealization processes, etc. Generating a non trivial set of generative processes, possibly forming a construction graph, can significantly improve the adequacy of some of these generative processes to meet user's application needs. This paper proposes to extract generative processes from a given B-rep shape as a high-level shape description. To evaluate the usefulness of this description, finite element analyses (FEA) and particularly idealizations are the applications selected to evaluate the adequacy of additive generative processes. Non trivial construction trees containing generic extrusion and revolution primitives behave like well established CSG trees. Advantageously, the proposed approach is primitive-based, which ensures that any generative process of the construction graph does preserve the realizability of the corresponding volume. In the context of FEA, connections between idealized primitives of a construction graph can be efficiently performed using their interfaces. Consequently, generative processes of a construction graph become a high-level object structure that can be tailored to idealizations of primitives and robust connections between them.},

@article{Beck2012,
abstract = {In this paper, the effects of uncertainty and expected costs of failure on optimum structural design are investigated, by comparing three distinct formulations of structural optimization problems. Deterministic Design Optimization (DDO) allows one the find the shape or configuration of a structure that is optimum in terms of mechanics, but the formulation grossly neglects parameter uncertainty and its effects on structural safety. Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) has emerged as an alternative to properly model the safety-under-uncertainty part of the problem. With RBDO, one can ensure that a minimum (and measurable) level of safety is achieved by the optimum structure. However, results are dependent on the failure probabilities used as constraints in the analysis. Risk optimization (RO) increases the scope of the problem by addressing the compromising goals of economy and safety. This is accomplished by quantifying the monetary consequences of failure, as well as the costs associated with construction, operation and maintenance. RO yields the optimum topology and the optimum point of balance between economy and safety. Results are compared for some example problems. The broader RO solution is found first, and optimum results are used as constraints in DDO and RBDO. Results show that even when optimum safety coefficients are used as constraints in DDO, the formulation leads to configurations which respect these design constraints, reduce manufacturing costs but increase total expected costs (including expected costs of failure). When (optimum) system failure probability is used as a constraint in RBDO, this solution also reduces manufacturing costs but by increasing total expected costs. This happens when the costs associated with different failure modes are distinct. Hence, a general equivalence between the formulations cannot be established. Optimum structural design considering expected costs of failure cannot be controlled solely by safety factors nor by failure probability constraints, but will depend on actual structural configuration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
